        <h3>A little about me:</h3>
        <p id="info">I am working on getting my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Communications.</br></br>
           I am from Vancouver, Washington but now live in Spokane while I attend Gonzaga University. <br><br>
           My parents live in Vancouver with my two brothers and my dog. Here is a picture of the two of us.
